    <h1> Dogs are cool </h1>
      <p> We just recently got a cavapoo dog and her name is Winnie. <strong>She is a 6 month old puppy that needs a lot of love</strong> and attention. Before DBC started, <em>I was the primary caretaker</em> of the puppy during the day, but now <em>my wife is helping</em> by stopping home during her lunch break.</p>
    <h2>Here are a few activties that we enjoy with our puppy:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Play fetch with a tennis ball </li>
      <li> Walk to the dog park to play with other dogs </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A few things we are still struggaling with as new puppy parents:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Finding the right dog food (Sometimes she doesnt eat!)</li>
      <li>Finding time to give her attention and go for walks during the day</li>
    </ol>
      <p>I used this webpage: <a href="http://html5doctor.com/author/jacko/">Jack Osborne</a> to help me build my puppy website.</p>
