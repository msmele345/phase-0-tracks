* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Verson control is a system that records changes to a "feature" or set of files over time. It allows you to roll back to any previous version if needed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a revision control system in which commits can be reviewed before they are merged into the master branch. It can be thought of like a "feature" being worked on for a project that if approved, will be merged into the master project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save of a file that is being worked on in git. A good commit message has detailed information on what updates were made from the previous version

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two branches are modified in the same region of a file and are subsequently merged. Git is unable to tell which changes to keep.
