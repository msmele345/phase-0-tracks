#Design Philosophies

*Open Source - source code and inner workings of the program are freely available for anyone to dl, modify or redistribute

*Programs are small  - each one does one thing exceptionaly well.
*Linux provides the ability to use she scripts to increase leverage and portability. This makes linux very customizable

#VPS
*A VM is a virtual chunk of memory that acts like a computer - runs its own OS and has its own files. A VM offers a cost effective alternative to a dedicated server. VMs offer a solution to those only looking for root access on a server.

#Bonus
*Vulnerability or malicious solftware concerns. More prone to user mistakes or software bugs - if run as root the program could possible delete critical files on your system.
